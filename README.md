**Thank you for this test review ü§ó. I am aware that the app is missing many things, it has others that could be improved and above all it can be made more scalable.
This is what I was able to do in the time I was able to dedicate. If you want to see a specific improvement or have questions about something, I can gladly resolve it.**
